Project Overview
The Pokémon Project aims to create an interactive experience that engages users with the Pokémon universe. The project may be an app, website, game, or another digital product that draws inspiration from the world of Pokémon. Its primary goal could include tasks like:

Objective: To create an immersive experience where users can interact with Pokémon characters, participate in battles, manage collections, or explore the Pokémon world through features such as gameplay, virtual interaction, or educational content.
Target Audience: Pokémon fans, gamers, and people who are interested in the franchise, including all age groups.
Mockup Overview
The Mockup is a visual representation of the project's user interface (UI) and key screens. It shows how the final product will look and gives stakeholders a clear idea of the user experience. The mockup might include:

Design Elements:

Landing Page: For a website, this could be the introductory screen with navigation options to various sections like "Pokémon Database," "Battles," or "User Profile."
Pokédex Screen: A section showcasing a searchable database of Pokémon, where users can view Pokémon details like types, stats, abilities, and evolutions.
Battle Screen: If the project includes a battle feature, this screen could showcase a battle interface where users can select Pokémon, use moves, and view battle results.
Profile Screen: A personalized area for users to track their collection of Pokémon, level-ups, and achievements.
Design Decisions
The design decisions for the project revolve around creating an intuitive, engaging, and visually appealing experience. Some of the key design decisions might include:

User Experience (UX):

Intuitive Navigation: Ensuring users can easily navigate between key sections of the app or site, such as the Pokédex, Battle mode, and Profile pages.
Accessibility: High contrast for readability, ensuring text is large enough and clear for all users, and including accessible features for colorblind users.
Responsive Design: The design adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
