        <p>This project showcases the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD), provided by NASA. Users can view daily pictures, 
        save their favourites, and learn more about the wonders of the universe.</p>

        <p>The APOD website was started by Robert Nemiroff and Jerry Bonnell in 1995 and has been a source of daily inspiration 
        and education ever since.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Input a specific date to view the APOD for that day.</li>
            <li>View the title, date, and explanation of each picture.</li>
            <li>Click on the picture to view it in high definition.</li>
            <li>Save your favourite pictures to view later.</li>
            <li>Manage your favourite pictures by deleting any you no longer wish to keep.</li>
